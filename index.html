        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Planning one’s self is a very important aspect of being very successful in all things that a person’s endeavors. Personally, I have come to realize that I archive a lot and complete all my daily or long-term tasks when I write them down rather than depending on my memory to do them. As part of Portfolio Project for Holberton School, implementing my API for task management system was one of the greatest accomplishments I consider to have achieved in my life. I look forward to improving my API to something that can be used to develop a mobile application or a website.</p>
